## How It Works

Here’s a breakdown of the plugin’s mechanics:

- **Data**: Pulls real-time financial data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.
- **ROE**: Calculates ROE with Net Income and Equity, handling missing data with a `try-except` block for robustness.
- **DCF**: 
  - Projects Free Cash Flow (FCF) for 10 years with a growth rate (capped at 7%).
  - Discounts it at a fixed 9% rate.
  - Adds a terminal value using the perpetuity growth model.
  - Divides the total by shares outstanding to get the per-share intrinsic value.
- **Moat**: Checks if profit margins exceed 20% and debt-to-equity is below 50% to evaluate competitive strength.
- **Output**: Delivers a neatly formatted report with all key metrics and a conclusion.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Place the Plugin**:
   - Save the `value_investor_analysis.py` file in the `core/cat/plugins/buffett_value_analysis/` directory of your Cheshire Cat installation.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Add the following line to your `requirements.txt` file in the plugin directory:
     ```
     yfinance
     ```
   - The Cheshire Cat will automatically install this dependency on restart.

3. **Restart Cheshire Cat**:
   - Restart your Cheshire Cat instance to load the plugin. If running via Docker, stop and restart the container.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the plugin by interacting with the Cheshire Cat AI:

- **Command**: Say "Analyze AAPL with Buffett’s method" (replace "AAPL" with any ticker symbol).
- **Result**: The plugin will fetch the data, run the analysis, and return a report like the one above.

### Practical Example
I tested it with AAPL (Apple). Using an FCF of $108.807 billion (2024), a 7% growth rate, and a 9% discount rate, the intrinsic value came out to $384.84 per share, against a current price of $209.68 – a 45.52% margin of safety! (Note: An earlier version reported $729.41 due to a data glitch, now corrected.)

## Technical Details

- **File**: `buffett_value_analysis.py`
- **Language**: Python
- **Dependency**: `yfinance` for financial data
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Growth Rate: Capped at 7% (configurable in code).
  - Discount Rate: Fixed at 9% (configurable in code).
- **Error Handling**: Uses `try-except` to manage missing or inconsistent data from Yahoo Finance.

## Future Improvements

This is just the beginning! Potential enhancements include:
- Adding support for longer historical data to refine growth estimates.
- Making growth and discount rates user-configurable.
- Expanding the moat analysis with more qualitative factors.
